Recap -

TestNG - Testng is a tool/framework which is based on annotations
       -- it provides multiple options for execution which can be integrated
       easily with selenium.

without testng - no priority for execution sequence
               -- no way to exclude the test case from execution
               -- no reporting structure

@Test annotation - to execute TC's we must write our method with @Test annotation

@BeforeMethod - it executes before every test as a pre condition
@AfterMethod - it executes after every test as a post condition

@BeforeClass - it executes once before the class executes
@AfterClass - it executes once after the class executes

Testng attributes -
priority - by default priority is set to 0
enabled - by default every TC true, if we need to exclude TC we have to set this to false

Assertion is of 2 types -
Hard assertion - the moment it finds an error, it stops execution and gives us the break point.
